            <p>My immersive experience caring for a loved one with dementia, coupled with a career in human services, draws me to the Dementia Program Coordinator position at CICOA.</p>
            <p>When my grandmother's dementia diagnosis emerged after my father's passing in April 2024, the experience profoundly transformed my understanding of dementia care. What began as a temporary support visit to Chicago quickly revealed a hidden challenge: her struggles with missed appointments, financial disarray, and cognitive decline had gone unrecognized by her medical team. After reviewing her records and identifying concerning patterns, I advocated for testing, which confirmed moderate-stage dementia.</p>
            <p>That visit evolved into nearly a year of comprehensive caregiving. Navigating unfamiliar systems with no clear starting point, I shifted immediately into problem-solving mode. After synthesizing her medical information and understanding her daily needs, I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Researched best practices in dementia care, consulting medical literature and connecting with local support agencies</li>
                <li>Co-developed <em>Love in the Balance</em>, a grant initiative supporting dementia caregivers experiencing sustained emotional stress</li>
                <li>Began writing <em>The Other Side of Dementia Caregiving: A Journey of Holding on While Letting Go</em>, a resource blending firsthand insight with practical wellness tools for families</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This turning point led to deeper engagement with care systems through research, community advocacy, and program design.</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, I’ve led cross-sector programs that drive measurable impact. As a project manager, I launched district-wide initiatives, tracked performance metrics, secured over $500,000 in program funding, and presented outcomes to public leadership. Building on this foundation, I later served as a school principal, where I built community systems, launched trauma-informed training programs, and facilitated educational events. My leadership also included overseeing a campus food distribution network serving over 1,000 families monthly and coaching 21 aspiring educators—18 of whom transitioned into permanent teaching roles.</p>
            <p>In my role as a Legal Fellow, I co-led trauma-informed trainings for law enforcement and authored public education tools adopted in statewide domestic violence reform. I also facilitated family support groups as an addictions counselor, supporting families navigating emotional strain and complex care systems. Collectively, these experiences reflect my ability to design, deliver, and evaluate high-impact training, volunteer coordination, and dementia-friendly outreach with precision, equity, and compassion.</p>
            <p>What excites me most is the opportunity to bridge systems and people. Ensuring care resources are both dignified and accessible for those affected by dementia is a mission I share with CICOA. It would be an honor to bring a blend of personal insight and coordination expertise to advance dementia-friendly communities through your vital work.</p>
            <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background aligns with your vision.</p>
            <p class="closing-signature">Warmly,<br>Marlitha Williams-Ragland, J.D.</p>
