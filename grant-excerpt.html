            <h1>"Love in the Balance" Grant Proposal Excerpt</h1>
            <p>A Trauma-Informed Support System for Caregivers of Someone with Dementia</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content-section">
            <p>This excerpt is from a grant initiative I co-developed to address the complex emotional landscape of caregiving for a family member with dementia. Rooted in lived experience and supported by research in trauma, memory care, and emotional regulation, the project explores how love—beyond sentiment—can serve as an anchor through overwhelm, resentment, guilt, and grief. Developed in alignment with the Greater Good Science Center’s initiative to elevate love as a powerful force in media and public health, Love in the Balance positions caregiving as both an act of service and a catalyst for emotional growth.</p>

            <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
            <p>Love in the Balance offers practical frameworks for caregivers facing sustained emotional strain, relational trauma, and the invisible labor of long-term support. It reframes love not as self-sacrificial endurance but as the intentional practice of dignity, regulation, and boundary-setting in the face of emotional volatility. Through science-backed strategies, caregiver reflections, and narrative tools, the project explores:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How unresolved dynamics shape the caregiving experience</li>
                <li>The role of compassion and emotional boundaries in sustaining care</li>
                <li>Techniques to regulate overwhelm without self-abandonment</li>
                <li>Love as a healing ethic for both caregiver and recipient</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Format & Reach</h3>
            <p>The initiative includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A 10-episode podcast featuring caregivers, dementia professionals, and trauma-informed practitioners</li>
                <li>A downloadable public wellness toolkit with journal prompts, boundary templates, and memory care planning tools</li>
                <li>Companion reflection worksheets for community use</li>
                <li>Scripts for emotionally charged care conversations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project was developed in collaboration with a wellness agency and public health consultants and is designed as a scalable resource for caregiver networks, nonprofit programming, and outreach educators.</p>

            <h3>Contribution & Significance</h3>
            <p>As co-developer, I crafted the narrative arc, shaped the educational components, and integrated feedback from health practitioners and caregiver communities. My contribution is grounded in personal experience providing full-time care for a grandparent with dementia, which gave rise to <em>The Other Side of Dementia Caregiving: A Journey of Holding on While Letting Go</em>, an upcoming book that interweaves story, science, and self-reflection.</p>
            <p>Love in the Balance embodies a core belief: love is not passive. It is an active discipline—especially in caregiving—that requires clarity, boundaries, and compassion. This project affirms that healing and support can coexist, even in the most emotionally charged caregiving environments.</p>
